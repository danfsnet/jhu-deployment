**Azure Managed Applications**

To publish a managed application to your service catalog, do the following tasks:

- Create an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) that defines the resources to deploy with the managed application.
- Define the user interface elements for the portal when deploying the managed application.
- Create a .zip package that contains the required JSON files. The .zip package file has a 120-MB limit for a service catalog's managed application definition.
- Publish the managed application definition so it's available in your service catalog.

**Defining Azure Portal Experience**

The user interface (UI) definition for a managed application is defined in a JSON file. The UI definition file is named createUiDefinition.json. 

The UI definition file defines the user interface elements for the portal when deploying the managed application.
